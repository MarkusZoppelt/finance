Bonus: GPG Encryption

This tool supports (gpg) encrypted csv files for secure sync between platforms via, e.g., git.
Decrypted values are never written to disk.

    # you will need a valid gpg key in ~/.gnupg/
    ./portfolio.py data.gpg

Pro Tip: Use a plugin like [vim-gnupg](https://github.com/jamessan/vim-gnupg) for editing your data file.
